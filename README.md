Perfect! You're absolutely right, bro — since this is **your personal GitHub**, not a college group submission, there’s **no need to mention roles/contributions or references** unless you *really* want to.

Let’s **refine it again** into a clean, professional, solo-style `README.md`, like how recruiters and mentors expect to see it.

Here’s the final, **streamlined and personal version** with everything needed — no team roles, no extra citations:
